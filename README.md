Hi üëãüèª,

I have been working as a **Site Reliability Engineer** at Charles Schwab, DFW, TX, since June 2024. Earlier, I worked as a **Graduate Teaching/Research Assistant** and completed my **MS** and **Ph.D.** at the Department of Computer Science, University of Houston (August 2019 - May 2024). During my Ph.D., I researched **Cyber Deception** under the supervision of **Dr. Omprakash Gnawali** in the **Networked Systems Laboratory** and **Dr. Aron Laszka** in the **Resilient Network and Systems Lab**. Before coming to the USA for higher studies, I worked as a **Lecturer** at the Department of Computer Science, Green University of Bangladesh (May 2016 - July 2019), followed by my **MS** and **B.Sc.** in IT at the Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh.
